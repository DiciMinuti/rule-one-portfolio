# Rule #1 Method

This app is inspired by Phil Town's public Rule #1 investing framework. It should paraphrase and attribute concepts, not copy course or book content. It should also avoid implying affiliation with Rule #1 Investing.

## Core Framework

Rule #1 investing is organized around the Four M's:

1. Meaning - stay inside your circle of competence and understand the business.
2. Moat - look for a durable competitive advantage.
3. Management - prefer honest, capable, owner-oriented leadership.
4. Margin of Safety - buy only when price is meaningfully below conservative value.

The app should use this as the top-level decision model.

## Big Five

The app should show the Big Five as a moat-quality and predictability check:

1. ROIC.
2. Sales growth.
3. EPS growth.
4. Equity/book value growth.
5. Cash flow growth.

Phil Town's public tutorial on the Big 4 describes book value per share, EPS, operating cash flow per share, and sales per share as moat/predictability indicators. The app can add ROIC to complete the Big Five and can show both operating cash flow and free cash flow when possible.

Target behavior:

- Display 10y, 5y, 3y, and 1y views.
- Mark strong values around 10%+ as green.
- Mark inconsistent, negative, missing, or deteriorating values clearly.
- Do not reduce the analysis to one number only.
- Show the underlying annual values so the user can see lumpiness.

## Valuation Model

The core Rule #1 sticker price flow:

1. Start with current or trailing-twelve-month EPS.
2. Pick a future growth rate.
3. Project EPS 10 years forward.
4. Pick a future PE.
5. Calculate future market price.
6. Discount that future price back to today using the required return.
7. Apply margin of safety, default 50%.

Default assumptions:

- Required return: 15%.
- Horizon: 10 years.
- MOS discount: 50%.
- Future PE: lower of historical high/average PE and 2x selected growth rate, with user override. Historical PE should use split-adjusted EPS when split data is available.
- Future growth: lower of split-adjusted historical EPS growth and analyst growth when both are positive, capped at 15% by default. Historical EPS growth uses 10 years when the CAGR can be calculated; otherwise it falls back to the longest usable positive EPS window. If historical EPS growth is zero or negative and analyst growth is positive, use analyst growth. Since free analyst data may not be reliable, manual entry must be first-class.

Formula:

```text
future_eps = current_eps * (1 + growth_rate) ^ years
future_price = future_eps * future_pe
sticker_price = future_price / (1 + required_return) ^ years
mos_price = sticker_price * (1 - margin_of_safety)
```

Example defaults:

```text
years = 10
required_return = 15%
margin_of_safety = 50%
```

## Payback Time

Payback time is an additional valuation lens. The public Rule #1 lesson frames it as the price at which earnings would pay back the purchase price in about 8 years.

V1 implementation:

- Show payback time as an optional secondary panel.
- Use conservative earnings/free-cash-flow assumptions.
- Let the user edit growth and payout assumptions.
- Label it as "secondary check" rather than the main decision.

## Management And CEO Reports

Management cannot be fully automated with free numerical data. The app should create a guided checklist and link users into primary-source documents:

- Latest 10-K.
- Latest 10-Q.
- DEF 14A/proxy statement when available.
- CEO/shareholder letter when identifiable.
- Business section.
- MD&A.
- Risk factors.

The app can extract and summarize filing sections later, but V1 can begin with links and user notes.

Management checklist:

- Do I trust management?
- Does leadership communicate clearly?
- Is capital allocation rational?
- Is debt manageable?
- Is compensation aligned with shareholders?
- Is the CEO/founder owner-oriented?
- Are there obvious governance concerns?

## Lessons

Lessons should be short, contextual, and app-native. Do not create a separate landing page or course website.

Lesson modules:

1. "Buy businesses, not tickers"
   - Teaches owner mindset and why descriptions/reports matter.

2. "Meaning"
   - Teaches circle of competence and why the user can mark a company as outside their world.

3. "Moat"
   - Teaches moat types: brand, price/cost advantage, secrets/IP, switching costs, toll bridge, network effects.

4. "The Big Five"
   - Teaches how the numbers can indicate durability and predictability.

5. "Management"
   - Teaches why leadership quality is judged manually using reports, proxy statements, history, and capital allocation.

6. "Sticker price"
   - Teaches EPS, growth, PE, future price, and discounting.

7. "Margin of safety"
   - Teaches why a good business can still be a bad buy at the wrong price.

8. "Payback time"
   - Teaches the secondary check and why simple assumptions matter.

9. "Saves discipline"
   - Teaches waiting, revisiting assumptions, and avoiding action just because a ticker is popular.

10. "Data humility"
   - Teaches that public filings are messy and every model is an estimate.

## Language Rules

Use:

- "Strong."
- "Middle."
- "Dull."
- "Pass: price is below MOS."
- "Almost: above MOS but not above sticker."
- "Nope: price is too high for this model."
- "Missing EPS. Enter EPS to finish valuation."
- "Only 6 annual periods found."

Avoid:

- "Buy now."
- "Sell now."
- "Guaranteed return."
- "Safe investment."
- "This stock will..."
